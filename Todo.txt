Small
1. Re-unite state types and do all changes (selection and map) through one state type?
2. Figure out more graceful way of handling the "Nothing" case so that the dropdown doesn't have the blank representing nothing
3. Put add/delete buttons on ListBasedEditable
4. Add a "change key" option?  It would have to remove the old and add it as a new one with a new key?

Medium
1. Make other containers work in this framework.
   a. All need to be made into maps?
   b. Flexibility in displayed keys?


Large/Hard
1. Make all Dynamics in/Events out or
2. Make a separate chain of Dynamics in/Dynamics out instances for performance.

These would both need to use the event setting option on the base widget configs. Don't quite see how yet.
