reflex-utils 

Various form and layout utilities for reflex-dom:

1. A utility to build forms from data structures. See app/SimpleForm/Main.hs for an example  
2. Some simple wrappers around flex-box css to make it easy to use flex for layout in rows and columns as well as to do centering.
3. Some more complex wrappers around flex and structured grids to allow for post-layout column-width calculation as well as the connecting of styling events to layout divs via tags.
4. An extremely simplified wrapper around the reflex-dom-contrib dynamic-tab function.  For quick deployment of a basic (and static) tabbed layout.

For examples of the latter 3, see app/layout/Main.hs


See stack.yaml for details of GHCJS version as well as relfex, reflex-dom, reflex-dom-contrib versions.
